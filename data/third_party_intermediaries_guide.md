## 🏢 1. IT Consultancies

- **Revenue Source**: Long-term contracts with clients for project delivery
- **Employee Relationship**: Often hire full-time employees (consultants) who work on client projects
- **Contract Duration**: 6 months to 3+ years per client engagement

### How They Work

- Win contracts from client companies for specific projects or ongoing support
- Assign their employees (consultants) to work on-site or remotely for clients
- Maintain employee benefits and job security even between client assignments
- Often specialize in specific technologies or industries

### Examples from Your Applications

## 📋 2. Recruitment Agencies

### Business Model

- **Core Focus**: Match candidates with job openings at client companies
- **Revenue Source**: Placement fees (15-30% of candidate's first-year salary)
- **Employee Relationship**: No employment relationship - pure intermediary
- **Contract Duration**: One-time placement service

### How They Work

- Client companies pay agencies to find suitable candidates

- Some offer temporary contracts before permanent placement

### Examples from Your Applications

- **Limited Insight**: May not fully understand role or company culture
- **Pressure**: Rush to place candidates to earn fees
- **No Ongoing Support**: Relationship ends after placement

### Risk Level: 🟡 MEDIUM

**Moderate safety** - Quality varies significantly by agency reputation
